//! The `kernel` suite: one test per scenario in `features/suites/kernel.feature`.
//!
//! The proofs are checked by the Lean kernel when `just vv` runs
//! `prismpm verify` on `app/`, and the examples are replayed in the compiled
//! guest by the same command. What these tests hold fixed is the claim each
//! proof is about: the theorem's exact statement and axioms, the proposition it
//! decides, the request bytes the proposition is read from, and that the
//! verdict the application returns is decided by the function the theorem is

//! verify, and would no longer be the claim the register makes.
